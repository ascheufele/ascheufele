## Hi, I'm Alex 👋

### 🎓 I'm a Computer Science graduate of the University of Massachusetts.

### ⌨ I like to write code in C, C++, and Python  
***
### 🎱 I'm currently developing an 8-bit CPU simulator in C++ that...
- Is based on my architecture design,
- Executes instructions via microcode,
- Employs an assembler I wrote in Python,
- Aims to help people understand computer architecture.
- Check out the repo ➡  [`8-bit-cpu-simulator`](https://github.com/ascheufele/8-bit-cpu-simulator)
#### I'm currently working on...
* Expanding the instruction set
* Developing a GUI with [`SFML`](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) to show real-time values across CPU components
***
### 🏎 I recently developed a Linux character driver that...
- Translates user space messages to morse code stored in kernel space
- Uses mutex in critical sections
- Adheres to strict documented requirements
- Verifies correctness via tests
- Check out the repo ➡  [`morse-character-driver`](https://github.com/ascheufele/morse-character-driver)
